# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Model
•	Built a Machine learning model in **TensorFlow** and trained it using the **MNIST** Dataset through **Keras**.  
•	Leveraged **NumPy** and **OpenCV** to collect and manipulate user input, used **Matplotlib** for testing purposes.  
•	Demonstrated a deep interest in AI/ML.  

# Web Interface
• A website written using **React** that takes the user's drawing on the **canvas** as input.  
• The trained model is converted to TensorFlow.js using tfjs_converter. It takes the input and predicts the digit that the user drew!  
• Demonstrated proficiency in **React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and general Frontend Developement knowledge.
